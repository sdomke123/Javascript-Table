# Javascript - Displaying data in JSON format in an HTML table
Using the data, index.html, and css files provided, Javascript code was written in order to display the data by adding onto HTML code in the index.html file. First, code was written to display all the data on the home page. Then, a filtering function was written so that when a relevant date was entered, only data from that date was displayed.
